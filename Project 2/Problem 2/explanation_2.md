I decided to use recursion for this problem because it is not known how deep the file structure will go.

The time complexity of find_files() is O(n)
Reason: O(n) where n is the number of files in the directory

The space complexity of find_files() is O(n)
Reason: A variable is allocated for the number of files in the directory
