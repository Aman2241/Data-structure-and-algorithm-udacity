# Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree

This repository contains the 3 projects I completed to attain my Data Structure and Algorithms Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Project 1
This project covers the foundations of Data Structures including Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Recursion, Trees, Maps, and Hashing.

## Project 2
This project covers basic algorithms including Binary Search, Heaps, Tries, Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Heap sort), and Divide and Conquer Algorithms.

## Project 3
This project covers advanced algorithms including Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, and Dynamic Programming. The final project utilized the A* Algorithm to create a route planner.
