# Problem 4

To solve this problem I kept a pointer to where the next 0 and 2 should be added. Following this method the 1's sorted themselves automatically. The array was sorted in one pass.

Time Complexity: O(n)

The array is iterated through once.

Space Complexity: O(1)

Sorting was done in place.
