# Problem 2

The rotated array is able to be searched using a Binary Search Algorithm. My first method involved finding the pivot seperately but I later realized this was not necessary and the element could be found in one pass.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Binary Search

Space Complexity: O(1)

No additional space is used
